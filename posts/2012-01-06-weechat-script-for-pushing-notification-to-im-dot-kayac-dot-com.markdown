I've written [WeeChat script for pushing notification to im.kayac.com](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/im_kayac_com_notify.py.html/).

This script is based on [notifo_notify.py](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/notifo_notify.py.html/).

This is the image of pushing notification to iPhone by this script.

This script is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mizzy/weechat-plugins/blob/master/im_kayac_com_notify.py).Pull requests are welcome.
