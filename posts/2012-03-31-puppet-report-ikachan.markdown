I've made a puppet module [puppet-report-ikachan](https://github.com/mizzy/puppet-report-ikachan) to send reports to [Ikachan](https://github.com/yappo/p5-App-Ikachan) and uploaded this module to [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/users/mizzy/modules/report_ikachan)

This is the screenshot of showing reports sent by this module on Limechat.

This module is very primitive, so please give me feedbak on [GitHub](https://github.com/mizzy/puppet-report-ikachan).
