I talked about [Maglica](https://github.com/mizzy/maglica) at [Hatena](http://hatena.ne.jp/) on Dec. 9, 2011.

I appreciate [@kentaro](http://twitter.com/#!/kentaro)-san and Hatena staffs.I had a very good time to talking with you and drinking Dr Peppers :-)

[This is the slide I talked](/slides/maglica/).

Maglica is a simple internal cloud tool I made.I don't like complicated and blackboxed tools.It seems for me that existing internal cloud tools are so complicated and overengineered for my use case.So I made the simple one.

"Tenjin" font is embedded in this slide using CSS Fonts Module. [@chocolatina](http://twitter.com/#!/chocolatina) made this cool font.
