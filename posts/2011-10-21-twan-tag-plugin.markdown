I've written [TWAN tag plugin](https://github.com/mizzy/jekyll-plugins/blob/master/twan_tag.rb) for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) which shows the image of [The World At Night](http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/index.asp).

If you call this plugin in a post like this:

	{% raw %}{% twan 3003406 %}{% endraw %}

The image shows up like this.

{% twan 3003406 %}
