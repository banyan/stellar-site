This is a picture of a shooting star of Gemnids I took on Dec. 15, 2011.I took over 2,000 pictures and only 3 pictures got a shooting star.

A red bright star on left side is Aldebaran of Taurus and dense small stars on center are Pleiades.

It was so cold but looking at stars and shooting stars were so fun.It would never be boring for me.
